Welcome to my journey through the **VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** üöÄ  
This repository will serve as a **week-by-week logbook** where I track my learning, completed tasks, and overall growth.  

The program focuses on taking a design from **RTL all the way to GDSII** using open-source EDA tools, as part of India‚Äôs **largest collaborative RISC-V initiative**. With 3500+ participants, this program strengthens India‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem while giving hands-on exposure to real-world SoC design and tapeout.

## üìÖ Week 0 ‚Äî Environment Setup & Tools  

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [**Task 0**](Week0/Task0/README.md) | üõ†Ô∏è Installed **Icarus Verilog**, **Yosys**, **GTKWave**,**Ngspice** and **Magic** for simulation & synthesis | ‚úÖ Completed |  

### üåü Key Takeaways from Week 0
- Successfully set up the required open-source EDA toolchain.  
- Understood the basics of preparing a working environment for RTL design.  
- Laid the foundation for the **RTL ‚Üí Netlist ‚Üí Layout** design flow.
